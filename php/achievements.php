			<h2>Achievements</h2>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Inventorisation of Endangered Plant Species</p>
			<p class="subText">Based on the survey and exploration as well as herbarium and literature studies, about 1500 species of flowering plants and few hundreds of Pteridophytes, Bryophytes, Lichens and Fungi have been identified as threatened. After careful and critical evaluation of their status and threat perceptions, the Survey has compiled Data Sheets on 1182 species, 708 of which have already been published as Red Data Book of Indian Plants: volume 1 – 3 (vol. 4 &amp; 5 are in press).</p>
			<p class="subText">The intensification of search for some of the extremely rare plant species in their known localities as well as in the areas having identical eco-climatic conditions have led in the rediscovery of species like Belosynapsis kewensis, Byrsophyllum tetrandrum, Claoxylon hirsutum, Didymocarpus missionis, D. ovalifolia, Eugenia floccosa, E.singampatiana, Exacum courtallense, Humboldtia unijuga, Pogostemon travancoricum, Casearia andamanica, Lactuca cooperi, Carex pamirensis, Cyathopus sikkimensis, Dicranostigma lactucoides, Cotoneaster lambertii, Trachycarpus takil, Radula assamica, Conocephalum supradecompositum, Daedoleopsis purpurea, Fistulina hepatica. Some even after more than hundred years since type collection.</p>
			<p class="subText">Recently, under a Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests sponsored research project, revalidation of rare taxa listed in Red Data Book (1 – 5) has been taken up by Botanical Survey of India in order to revise their status as per the latest IUCN - 2001 categories.</p>
			<p class="subText">The Survey has also been instrumental in the establishment of Nepethes and Citrusgene Sanctuary in Meghalaya and Rhododendron and Orchid sanctuaries in Sikkim.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Ex-situ Conservation</p>
			<p class="subText">Botanical Survey of India is actively engaged in the ex-situ conservation through its chain of Botanic gardens established in different regional circles. They are actively engaged in collection, introduction, multiplication and maintenance of germplasm of orchids, bamboos, palms, medicinal plants, legumes, ferns, wild edible plants, insectivorous plants, gymnosperms and other economically important plant species. Over 1,50,000 live plants belonging to c. 4,000 largely indigenous and highly valued economic exotic species are under cultivation including more than 200 species of endemic, rare and threatened category, some of which are included in the Appendix - I and Appendix - II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) such as - Renanthera imschootiana, Vanda coerulea, Paphiopedilum spp. Nepenthes kahasiana, Saussurea costus, Cycas beddomei, Bentinckia condapanna, B. nicobarica, Trachycarpus takil, Cypripedium spp., Eremostachys superba, , Taxus wallichiana, Myristica andamanica, Rauvolfia serpentina, Dioscorea deltoidea, Podophyllum hexandrum, Cyathea spp., Ceropegia spp., Frerea indica, Cephalotaxus mannii, etc.</p>
			<p class="subText">Mass multiplication of some of the rare and highly valued ornamental orchids like Paphiopedilum spp., Vanda coerulea, Dendrobium spp., Cymbidium spp., insect eating Nepenthes khasiana, medicinal plants like Clerodendrum colebrookianum, Panax pseudoginseng, Litsea cubeba, Aquilaria malaccensis and near extinct Eremostachys superba , through tissue culture has also been taken up successfully by Botanical Survey of India.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Fragile Ecosystems</p>
			<p class="subText">Floristic studies of more than 25 fragile ecosystems, like Cold Deserts of Trans-Himalayas, Mothronwala freshwater swamps, Rann of Kutch, Agumbe, Nallamalais, Chilika Lake, Mahanadi delta, Mangrove ecosystems, Coastal ecosystems, etc. have also been completed and many others are under investigation.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Protected Areas</p>
			<p class="subText">The Survey has completed floristic studies on five Biosphere Reserves namely – Great Nicobar, Nilgiri, Gulf of Mannar, Manas and Nanda Devi and 31 National Parks. Out of this taxonomic accounts of 4 Biosphere Reserves and five National Parks have been published.</p>
			<p class="subText">Whereas, studies on remaining 7 Biosphere Reserves is in progress. Besides, accounts of the floristic diversity in 23 Tiger Reserves and some selected Wildlife Sanctuaries have also been brought out by the Survey.</p>
			<p class="subText">Under a recently sanctioned research project by MoEF entitled “Assessment of Floristic Diversity in Protected areas of India, Phase – I: - The Biosphere Reserves and National Parks”. Botanical Survey has taken up the detailed study of the various aspects of the floristic diversity in the remaining Biosphere Reserves and National Parks of the country.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Ethnobotanical Studies</p>
			<p class="subText">India has about 563 tribal communities having age-old traditional knowledge through their long association with the forests. They have accumulated valuable knowledge on the use of wild plants in their daily life for food, fuel, fodder, clothing, health-care and other purposes. Botanical Survey of India initiated recording and documenting this ethnobotanical data of all tribes belonging to the states of Bihar, Goa, Karnataka, Orissa Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Uttaranchal, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal for critical studies leading to sustainable utilisation of bioresources, documentations of traditional knowledge system.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Environmental Impact Assessment</p>
			<p class="subText">Ever since the Environmental Impact assessment in relation to major developmental projects was made mandatory by the Govt. of India, Botanical Survey of India has carried out such studies on the flora of more than 100 such major project sites.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Geobotanical Studies</p>
			<p class="subText">The Survey has also successfully carried out and completed the Geobotanical and Bio-geochemical studies in Singhbhum Copper belt, Bihar and Khetri Copper belt in Rajasthan in collaboration with Geological Survey of India.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">National Database</p>
			<p class="subText">Database on Indian flora, herbarium holdings and taxonomic bibliography is being done at the Computer Units of Northern Circle, Dehra Dun and Southern Circle, Coimbatore.</p>

			<p class="subText subtitle">Environmental Education	and Awareness</p>
			<p class="subText">Botanical Survey of India with its more than 30,000 museum exhibits helps in creating general awareness amongst students and general public about the role of plants in promoting the quality of human life and maintenance of healthy environment.</p>
			<p class="subText">The Survey also organises Film/Slide shows, Lectures, tree plantations Exhibitions, Sit and Draw /Quiz competitions involving school students to generate awareness on various plant related environmental and conservation issues.</p>
			<p class="subText subtitle">Capacity Building in Plant Taxonomy</p>
			<p class="subText">Lack of expertise in the taxonomy of various groups of plants had been a major constraint in fulfilling some of the commitments of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Survey organises regular programmes for training Research Scholars in different groups of plant Taxonomy for the award of Ph.D. degree by various Indian Universities.</p>
			<p class="subText">The survey also imparts in-service basic and advance training in plant taxonomy and herbarium methodology to other institutions.</p>
			<p class="subText">"All India co-ordinated project on the Capacity Building in Taxonomy”, funded by the MoEF, a Centre each for Lichens &amp; Bryophytes and Grasses &amp; bamboos have been established at Allahabad, Kolkata and Coimbatore circles of Botanical Survey of India to develop expertise in these groups of plants.</p>
